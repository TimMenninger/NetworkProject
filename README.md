Questions for Ritty:

If we are doing Discrete Event Simulation, what do the events look like?  
The global queue of events store (Event, time) tuples, right?

Can we talk through the process of sending packets from one host to another
and as it relates to the Link Rate, Link Delay, and Link Buffer? Just need
general clarification as for what those terms are and how they affect the 
process of sending packets from hosts to other hosts/routers. 

Need to get good definitions for some important terms, hard to find: 
1. Buffer Occupancy
2. Packet Loss 
 	(Just the number of packets lost, right? But is it per flow? total?)
3. Flow Rate

Do our classes have all the attributes they need to be able to measure 
everything that they need to measure?  

Do we need a simulation class? / Where is the best place to store the data 
for the metrics during the simulation?
