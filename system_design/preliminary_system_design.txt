CS 143 Network Simulator Project
Preliminary Design

========== Tools/Software Decisions ==========

- Programming Language: Python
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/patrickgalliani/CS143Project

========== Simulator Design ==========

- Discrete Event Simulation
    - Global queue of events where each item in the queue is a tuple containing
    the event that has to occur and the time it has to occur: (Event, Time)
    - Once one event is processed, pick item out of queue that is supposed to 
    occur next
    - Simulation is over when queue is empty

========== Global Values ==========

PACKET_SIZE = 1024 bits

========== Classes ==========

--- Host ---

Description: 
- End points in the network
- Know nothing about other hosts in the network

Attributes:
- hostname : name of the host, each hostname is unique (i.e., "H1")


--- Router ---

Description: 
- Route packets through the network
- Calculate routing tables with decentralized shortest-path algorithms
- Decides where to send packets based on packed destination
- No global knowledge of network topology

Attributes: 
- router_id : each router_id is unique
- routing_table : a python dictionary where key is the destination hostname and
			      value is the Link the  

--- Link ---

Description: 
- Half-duplex (data can travel in both directions, but not at the same time)
- Have transmission delay, how long a packet will go from one end to the other
- Have buffer of packets to send on either end
- Packets dropped when buffer is full

Attributes: 
- link_id : unique for each Link
- capacity : how fast a router they can send data (in MB/sec)
- delay : amount of time it takes to send Packet down link (in ms)
- buffer : a list of Packet that are waiting to go down the link (on either end)
           (in KB)

--- Packet ---

Description: 
- Units of data that are sent through the network

Attributes: 
- packet_id : unique for each Packet
- packet_flow : the Flow that the Packet belongs to (gives access to source and 
			    destination)
- packet_payload : the actual data being sent or the acknowledgement


--- Flow ---

Description: 
- Represent data being sent from one host to another
- Do not know about other flows in network
- Generate packets to send from source to destination in accordance with 
congestion control algorithm

Attributes: 
- flow_id : unique to each flow
- flow_src : IP address of source host
- flow_dest : IP address of destination host
- flow_size : amount of data being sent (in MB)
- flow_start : the time the flow started (in sec)
- flow_packets : a list of packet_id being sent in the flow
